<h1>What is SMIRC?</h1>
<p>
	SMIRC (Short Message Internet Relay Chat) is a fusion of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Short_Message_Service">Short Message Service</a>
	(also known as "SMS" or "texting" to most any user of a cellphone) and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Relay_Chat">Internet Relay Chat</a>.
	A typical SMS (text message) sent from a phone is targeted to a single recipient and although phones are getting smarter and better able to send
	multi-recipient text messages the ability to have a multi-person conversation (as is common in e-mail) is still largely missing.  SMIRC's goal is
	to expose this functionality to it's users, so that they are able to quickly and easily have multi-recipient conversations.  On SMIRC, therefore,
	a message is targeted at <i>a conversation</i>, rather than at <i>a person</i>.
</p>

<h1>How does it work?</h1>
<p>
	SMIRC works by receiving messages on a phone number (currently SMIRC is available in Canada only, at the phone number 780-729-1450) and then
	relaying them (copying them) to all of the people in the target conversation.  As a simple example of how this works in practice, assuming that there are three
	friends (we'll call them "Zim", "Gir", and "Tallest") who are all in the SMIRC conversation "OID2" together:
	
	<ol>
		<li>
			Zim sends a text message to SMIRC:
			<code>@OID2 Come, GIR.  Let us rain some doom down upon the heads of our doomed enemies.</code>
		</li>
		<li>
			Upon receipt of the message, SMIRC determines that it is targeted at the conversation "OID2" (which Zim is a member of), and then
			forwards it to all the other participants of that conversation (in this case, Gir and Tallest).
		</li>
		<li>
			Gir and Tallest both receive a text message from SMIRC:
			<code>Zim@OID2: Come, GIR.  Let us rain some doom down upon the heads of our doomed enemies.</code>
		</li>
		<li>
			Gir responds to Zim's text message, sending a text message to SMIRC:
			<code>@OID2 Aww, but I wanna watch the Scary Monkey Show!</code>
		</li>
		<li>
			Zim and Tallest both receive a text message from SMIRC:
			<code>Gir@OID2: Aww, but I wanna watch the Scary Monkey Show!</code>
		<li>
	</ol>

<h1>How does it work?  What does it look like?</h1>
<p>
	An example of how SMIRC can work: let's assume that there are three friends (we'll call them Zim, Gir, and Tallest) who want to have conversations
	through text messaging.  Typically, each of them would need to make very sure that they always listed all of the recipients for each text message
	that they sent... and if Gir (for example) hit "reply" to a text message from Zim and forgot to add Tallest as a recipient, then only Zim would receive
	the message and Tallest might be out of the loop.  Of course the Tallest won't stand for this, so all three join SMIRC and find that it
	can make staying in sync easier:
	
	<div>
	First, all three join SMIRC:
	
	<div>
		<div>To: SMIRC<br>
		<code>/NICK Zim</code>
		</div>
		<div>From: SMIRC<br>
		<code>SMIRC: your nickname has been changed to Zim</code>
		</div>
	</div>

	<div>
		<div>To: SMIRC<br>
		<code>/NICK Gir</code>
		</div>
		<div>From: SMIRC<br>
		SMIRC: your nickname has been changed to Gir
		</div>
	</div>

	<div>
		<div>To: SMIRC<br>
		/NICK Tallest
		</div>
		<div>From: SMIRC<br>
		SMIRC: your nickname has been changed to Tallest
		</div>
	</div>
