SMIRC

<h1>What is SMIRC?</h1>
<p>
	SMIRC (Short Message Internet Relay Chat) is a fusion of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Short_Message_Service">Short Message Service</a>
	(also known as "SMS" or "texting" to most any user of a cellphone) and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Relay_Chat">Internet Relay Chat</a>.
	A typical SMS (text message) sent from a phone is targeted to a single recipient and although phones are getting smarter and better able to send
	multi-recipient text messages the ability to have a multi-person conversation (as is common in e-mail) is still largely missing.  SMIRC's goal is
	to expose this functionality to it's users, so that they are able to quickly and easily have multi-recipient conversations.  On SMIRC, therefore,
	a message is targeted at a <i>room of people</i>, rather than at <i>a person</i>.
</p>

<h1>How does it work?  What does it look like?</h1>
<p>
	An example of how SMIRC can work: let's assume that there are three friends (we'll call them Zim, Gir, and Tallest) who want to have conversations
	through text messaging.  Typically, each of them would need to make very sure that they always listed all of the recipients for each text message
	that they sent... and if Gir (for example) hit "reply" to a text message from Zim and forgot to add Tallest as a recipient, then only Zim would receive
	the message and Tallest might be out of the loop.  Of course the Tallest won't stand for this, so all three join SMIRC and find that it
	can make things easier:
